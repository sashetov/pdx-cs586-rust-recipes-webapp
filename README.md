# PDX PSU CS-586 Spring 2025 Rust Web
## `recipe-server`
### Description

Serves MIT licensed recipes. Recipes retrieved from https://github.com/Donearm/Cooking-Recipes/tree/master, which is MIT licensed and so the current license preserves that.

Much of the original inspiration for the web app itself comes from code written during the rust class, so from different branches in this repository: https://github.com/pdx-cs-rust-web/knock-knock, which is also MIT licensed, for similar reasons.
